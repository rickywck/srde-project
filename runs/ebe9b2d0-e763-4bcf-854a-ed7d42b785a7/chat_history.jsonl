The key points include:\n\n1. **Voice-Based Chatbot**: The system should enable customers to submit disputes using a voice interface.\n\n2. **Information Capture**: The chatbot should attempt to capture necessary information to create a request when the customer submits a dispute.\n\n3. **Supplementary Information**: Customers should have the ability to provide additional information, such as evidence, at a later time. This should be done by quoting a reference number associated with their initial request.\n\nThis document seems to outline a functional requirement for a customer service or dispute resolution system with a focus on user interaction through a voice-enabled interface.\n"}
